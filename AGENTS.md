# AGENTS

This repository uses automated agents for maintenance tasks.

## Guidelines
- Prioritize stability and backwards compatibility (legacy PHP 5.6 / Node.js 12).
- Avoid unnecessary refactors or modernization.
- Keep changes minimal, targeted, and well-scoped.
- Prefer existing project patterns and conventions.
- Document any operational changes in the main README if needed.

## Safety
- Do not modify production credentials or secrets.
- Do not change environment detection or deployment defaults unless explicitly requested.

## Communication
- Keep responses concise and focused on the requested change.
